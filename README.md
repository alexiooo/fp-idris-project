# Running the project

The code was ran and tested against Idris2, version 0.5.1

Idris might not recognize literate Idris files with .tex extension when resolving import, 
but it will happily compile them when called directly.
So, if you encounter errors, please run the `build.sh` script.
If you don't have `bash` on your system, you can still consult the aforementioned build script
for the order in which to manually compile the modules.
